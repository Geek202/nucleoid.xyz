A free-for-all party game in which players compete to be the "King of the Hill" (however, people of any identity can play this game). Standing on a capture point gives points, and the person with the most points at the end of the time limit wins. If there are multiple people on the capture point at the end of the game, and the would-be winner is one of them, the game will enter Deathmatch until the person with the most points is the sole person on the capture point.  

There is also a "Deathmatch Mode", not to be confused with the feature in the standard mode, which is more of a last-player-standing game. The first player to win three rounds wins. 

There are quite a few different configurations included with the base game, including different maps, deathmatch maps, and variations of maps using a bow or a leaping feather (which allows the player to leap when pressing the use button).
