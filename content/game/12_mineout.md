Mineout is a free-for-all party game in which players must reach the end of a set course.
The default map has four sections: 
- Bridging: players must bridge to the other side of a large gap while it decays behind them
- Elytra: players must fly through scattered blocks to get to the other side
- Riptide: players must use a Riptide trident to fly through hoops
- Parkour: players must cross a lava pit by parkour
