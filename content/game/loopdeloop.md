A free-for-all party game in which players must fly through loops and get to the end the quickest. A player can get fireworks back after depleting them by failing or going through a ring. 

On the official Nucleoid server, there is the standard mode, an amplified version with extra Y variation, a fast version, a long version, a ridiculous version with insane amounts of Y variation, and a "Flappy Mode" version.
