+++

A free-for-all party game in which players must fly through loops and get to the end the quickest. A player can get fireworks back after depleting them by failing or going through a ring. 

Configuration options are available to change basically everything about the game: 
- The number of loops 
- The time limit 
- The amount of rockets the player starts with 
- The Y and Z variation 
- The loop radius 
- "Flappy Mode", turns the game into a form of Flappy Bird instead of an elytra challenge. 

On the official Nucleoid server, there is the standard mode, an amplified version with extra Y variation, a fast version, a long version, a ridiculous version with insane amounts of Y variation, and a "Flappy Mode" version.
