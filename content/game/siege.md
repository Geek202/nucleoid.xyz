A work-in-progress team-based game in which players on the Attacker team must take over all of the territory of the players on the Defender team before time runs out. The Attackers get a slight speed buff to even the playing field. There are a few different kits to choose from, allowing for more varied gameplay. A kit's resources are limited, and can be restocked by using an ender chest. The kits currently include: 
- Archer, gets a wooden sword, a bow, ten steak, and sixteen arrows. Their armor is all leather. 
- Soldier, gets an iron sword, a stone axe, and ten steak. Their armor is all leather except for the chestplate and boots, which are diamond and iron respectively. 
- Shield Bearer, gets an iron sword, ten steak, and a shield. Their armor is all iron except for the boots and helmet, which are leather. 
- Constructor, gets a wooden sword, a wooden axe, four ladders, ten steak, and eight wooden planks. Their armor is all leather. 

Configuration options are available to change whether the Defenders can recapture their territory.
