A free-for-all game in which players must try and dig out the ground beneath another player's feet, forcing them to fall to lower levels and eventually lava.  

Configuration options are available to change basically everything about the game: 
- The block used for the ground 
- The block used for the walls 
- The pattern of the walls (Square, Circle, Patterned) 
  - If the walls are a circle or a square, the inner radius can be changed to make a donut shape. 
-  The scale and shape of the map 
- The tools players get 
- The time it takes for blocks to decay 
- The time it takes for each floor to fall 
- If players get projectiles, and which 

There are too many configurations on the official Nucleoid server to even think about listing here, but some major ones are: Traditional Spleef (snow with shovels), Trapdoor Spleef (Spleef but you have to open trapdoors to kill the other players), and TNT Run (In which you do not get any tools, but instead the decay is nigh-instant).  

There are three configurations included with the base minigame, being Traditional Spleef, Traditional Spleef but with block decay, and Projectile Spleef, where players get snowballs and can throw them to destroy blocks.
