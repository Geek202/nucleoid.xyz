Spleef is free-for-all game in which players must try and dig out the ground beneath another player's feet, forcing them to fall to lower levels and, eventually, into lava!  

There are many variations of the Spleef minigame with varying blocks such as snow, ice, magma, slime, and honey blocks, which all introduce interesting twists to regular gameplay.
In some modes, blocks will break behind players as they move, and in others, players will receive snowballs which they can use to destroy blocks from a distance.
