A free-for-all game in which players must try and dig out the ground beneath another player's feet, forcing them to fall to lower levels and eventually lava.  

There are too many variations on the official server to list, but some major ones include: Traditional Spleef (snow with shovels), Trapdoor Spleef (Spleef but you have to open trapdoors to kill the other players), and TNT Run (In which you do not get any tools, but instead the decay is nigh-instant).  

There are three configurations included with the base minigame, being Traditional Spleef, Traditional Spleef but with block decay, and Projectile Spleef, where players get snowballs and can throw them to destroy blocks.
