A team-based game where players must bridge over the void to other people's bases in order to break their beds. Once a bed is broken, that team is unable to respawn. There is a gold and iron generator at each team's base, allowing them to get basic tools such as building blocks or pickaxes. In an island adjacent to them, there is a diamond generator, which allows one to buy a team upgrade. Team upgrades affect the entire team, ranging from a haste buff to a heal pool covering the team's island.  In the center island(s), there are the elusive emerald generators. Emeralds allow a player to buy the most powerful tools, such as a diamond sword, obsidian to protect their bed, or a trident. 

Configuration options are available to change the number of teams, the map/generation, and the block which is used to respawn. 

The official Nucleoid server has two options: 2 teams and 4 teams, encompassing all maps that correspond to those team numbers.
