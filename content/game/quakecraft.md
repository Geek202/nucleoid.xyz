Quakecraft is a fast-paced free-for-all game in which players must battle each other to 24 kills.

Players can make use of various weapons, such as: 
- A railgun, which shoots a ray directly forward, instantly killing anything in its path. Clicking the attack button instead of the use button will propel the player forwards.
- A rocket launcher, which shoots a fireball that has an area-of-effect impact.
- A grenade launcher, which shoots a grenade in the direction the player is facing. The grenade will blow up after a few seconds.
