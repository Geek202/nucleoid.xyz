A free-for-all game in which players use a variety of projectiles to kill each other. The first person to 24 kills, or the one with the highest kill-count before the time runs out, wins! The weapons include: 
- A railgun, which shoots a ray directly forward, instantly killing anything in its path. Clicking the attack button instead of the use button will launch the player forwards and slightly upwards. 
- A rocket launcher, which shoots a fireball in the direction the player is facing. If the player who shot the fireball is hit by it, they will be launched upward with varying velocity. 
- A grenade launcher, which shoots a grenade affected by gravity in the direction the player is facing. The grenade will blow up after a few seconds. 

Configuration options are available to change the map and what time the match takes place.  

There are two maps included with the minigame, and two variations of each of them.
