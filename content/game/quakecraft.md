A free-for-all game in which players use a variety of projectiles to kill each other. The first person to 24 kills, or the one with the highest kill-count before the time runs out, wins! The weapons include: 
- A railgun, which shoots a ray directly forward, instantly killing anything in its path. Clicking the attack button instead of the use button will launch the player forwards and slightly upwards. 
- A rocket launcher, which shoots a fireball in the direction the player is facing. If the player who shot the fireball is hit by it, they will be launched upward with varying velocity. 
- A grenade launcher, which shoots a grenade affected by gravity in the direction the player is facing. The grenade will blow up after a few seconds. 

There are two maps included with the minigame, and two variations of each of them.
